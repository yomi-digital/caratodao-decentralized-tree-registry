# Carato DAO - Decentralized Tree Registry

Tree registry is a smart-contract developed on the FEVM, the Filecoin EVM-compatible virtual machine.


Each tree is issued as an NFT by the community and the DAO members are dynamic. Each 3 participants 1 new signature is required to accomplish tasks inside the contract. Metadata are stored and served directly by the contract, so are completely on-chain.


Operations are also gasless, because a backend (or a member) collects all the requests (to go at web2 speed) and processes them in the background while the DAO can operate fast. This means also a non-member can ask for inclusion.


This is a Proof of Concept, developed between 18th and 20th November 2022, during the first FEVM Hackaton hosted by EthGlobal.


Anyway Carato is a real project and we plant trees for real, support us!
